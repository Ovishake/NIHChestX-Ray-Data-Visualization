# NIHChestX-Ray-Data-Visualization
Visualizing the data in the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
Trying to interpret the data before applying Deep Learning.

So as to estimate that the Deep Learning Model is learning the right kind of distributions to approximate and predict.

Download the data from: Kaggle NIH Chest X-Ray along with the Bbox.

For example the data below helps us in identifying mislabeled bounding boxes based on where in the x-ray the lung image could be, thereby reducing the misclassification and improving the ROCAUC of the model.
